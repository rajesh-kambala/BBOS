If you register to become a Blue Book Member, we will endeavor to collect information from you about your business, such as trade name, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, personnel names and background, financial details, the names of firms with which you regularly transact business, and credit/debit card information.  You may also submit information about other businesses and individuals, such as names, addresses, and your confidential trading experiences.  Similar information may be provided by Members and non-Members, at their option, while making an online order for products and services.  This optional information is treated separately from the required ordering information described below.  All registration information becomes a part of the Produce Reporter Co.'s database that is used by us in connection with providing our products and services to those entities and individuals utilizing Blue Book offerings.  For example, Produce Reporter Co. may use this personally identifiable information to create Online Business Reports for sale to the public or to license the use of such information to our third party business partners.

<P>
Our primary sources of information are businesses and individuals actively engaged in the wholesale fresh fruit and vegetable trading and transportation industries, as well as public records such as business registrations, Uniform Commercial Code filings and bankruptcy filings.  We believe that data quality is of the utmost importance.  As a result, we will implement exhaustive practices and policies to ensure that all data is as accurate, timely and complete as possible.
