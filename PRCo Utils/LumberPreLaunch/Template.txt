Very soon, Blue Book Services will begin providing credit and marketing services to the wholesale lumber and forest products industry.  

Earlier this year, a representative from your business provided information to establish your firm’s Blue Book listing.  We are following up with you today to confirm the business information we will be reporting on your business when we launch the Lumber Blue Book later this summer.

After reviewing the attached documents, please communicate any changes or additions by e-mail or fax.  Given the real time nature of Blue Book Online Services, changes to your Blue Book listing can be reported at any time during the calendar year.

Thank you for taking the time to review your Blue Book listing information.  We look forward to serving you!
