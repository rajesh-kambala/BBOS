Very soon, Blue Book Services will begin providing credit and marketing services to the wholesale lumber and forest products industry.  As a commercial credit rating agency, we will be listing any and all wholesale lumber businesses.  To date, we have not received a response to our previous requests to validate your company information.

If we do not receive a response from your firm by August 31, we will assume the attached information is correct and it will be reported via Blue Book Online Services (at no charge).  Please communicate any changes or additions by e-mail or fax.  Given the real time nature of Blue Book Online Services, changes to your Blue Book listing can be reported at any time during the calendar year.

Thank you!
