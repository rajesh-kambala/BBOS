        IMPORTANT -
        PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:
    </span>This Membership Application &amp; Agreement (&quot;Membership
    Agreement&quot; or &quot;Agreement&quot;) constitutes a legal agreement between you (either an
    individual person or a single legal entity, who will be referred to in this
    Agreement as &quot;you&quot;) and Blue Book Services, LLC. (&quot;BBS&quot;) regarding the terms of
    your membership, including without limitation, your authorized use, if any, of
    BBS products and services, including information and reports from the Blue Book Database, whether delivered in any print or electronic format, the BBS Website, and web-based applications, collectively referred to herein as &quot;Products and Services.&quot;  The Products and Services also include any software, updates, add-on components, web services and/or supplements, and any products or services you may request or purchase from BBS by and through these Products and Services after the date you first access the Products and Services to the extent that such items are not accompanied by an additional or separate license agreement or terms of use.
</p>

<p>BBS agrees to furnish the specified Products and Services upon its acceptance of your membership application. Upon acceptance of your application, BBS will grant you a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use the Products and Services subject to the terms set forth in this agreement AND any other agreement (e.g. Terms of Use) that accompanies the Products and Services.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">You acknowledge and agree that the Database and all ratings, reports, and information obtained by or through these Products and Services, or by and through Blue Book membership, are provided for your internal use only, and you may not loan or show or in any way share or distribute such ratings, reports, information, or data to third-parties. Sharing of login credentials (i.e., usernames and passwords), within your organization or externally, is prohibited. </span> </p>

<p>You agree, to the extent you have actual or apparent authority to do so, that any person using or assigned login credentials on behalf of you or your company has authority to use the Products and Services and to purchase additional products and services (e.g. business reports, additional user licenses, and collection services) on behalf of you or your company except to the extent you  may expressly limit such authority with written notice to BBS prior to the use or purchase in question.  You further agree not to post, provide, or share the BBS credit rating assigned to you or your firm with any third-party for publication on the internet, in print, or otherwise, including e-commerce websites or other electronic or print directories or databases. You understand and agree that all ratings, reports, and information are provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis without any guarantee of correctness, accuracy, or completeness, and will not be the basis for any attempt to hold BBS liable on any ground for any loss or injury.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the initial year of service, this membership subscription will automatically renew for successive one-year periods; however, you may cancel your subscription by providing written notice prior to the beginning of any membership year. If your membership is paid online, BBS utilizes a PCI compliant third-party payment processor to process and store your payment method.  You acknowledge and agree that BBS will charge your designated payment method for any invoices, including those issued upon renewal of your membership term, on their due date.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree not to ask payment method provider to charge back any charges billed according to this Agreement.  In the event your membership subscription lapses (without payment or notice of cancelation) your membership will be terminated for non-payment at BBS's sole discretion usually within 90 days, and you will be billed on a pro rata basis for the time you had the opportunity to access the Products and Services. In the event of cancelation or termination of your membership, you will still be responsible for paying BBS any outstanding amounts due, and any amounts that may subsequently become due</p>

<p>If you provide any message or information to BBS via the Products and Services, or otherwise, you agree that the information provided is to the best of your knowledge and belief, true, correct, accurate, and not misleading. By providing any message or information, you grant to BBS the royalty-free irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to use, distribute, display and create derivative works from this material, in any and all media, in any manner, in whole or in part, without any restriction or responsibilities to you. (Please see BBS's Privacy Policy posted on the Web Site for information on BBS's use of information you may provide.)</p>

<p>Fees are payable annually (in U.S. funds) at the beginning of each membership year and are nonrefundable.  Any change in membership fees or modification of membership terms will be effective upon notice being communicated by mail or e-mail or by notice on the BBS Web Site. Additional fees may apply in the event of special billing arrangements, checks issued in payment for services returned unpaid, or collection assistance and attorneys' fees required to secure payment.</p>

<p>BBS reserves the right to terminate the membership of any Member who violates any of the terms of this Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy available on our website, and any other agreement (e.g., Trading or Transportation Member Agreement) or terms of use entered into between you and BBS, represents the entire agreement between you and BBS with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communications between you and BBS concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.</p>

<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard for the conflict of laws provisions thereof.  This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is hereby expressly excluded. If any part of this Agreement is found, inapplicable, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it will not affect the validity of the balance of this Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. </p>
