<p>
    Upon completion of the initial year of service, this membership subscription will automatically renew for successive one-year periods; however, you may cancel your subscription by providing written notice prior to the beginning of any membership year. In the event your membership subscription lapses (without payment or notice of cancellation) your membership will be terminated for non-payment at BBS’s sole discretion usually within 90 days, and you will be billed on a pro rata basis for the time you had the opportunity to access the Products and Services. In the event of cancellation or termination of your membership, you will still be responsible for paying BBS any outstanding amounts due, and any amounts that may subsequently become due. Your membership may also be terminated if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement or fail to pay for any products and services purchased from BBS. Your membership may also be terminated or restricted if you fail to comply with the Blue Book Membership Agreement, or <a href="https://www.producebluebook.com/community-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Standards</a>.  
</p>

<p>
    If your membership subscription is paid online, BBS utilizes a PCI compliant third-party payment processor to process and store your payment method. You acknowledge and agree that BBS will charge your designated payment method for any invoices, including those issued upon renewal of your membership term, on their due date. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree not to ask payment method provider to charge back any charges billed according to this Agreement. 
</p>

<p>
    Fees are payable annually (in U.S. funds) at the beginning of each membership year and are nonrefundable.
