<b>Your role as a beta tester:</b> We appreciate your willingness to help test Blue Book Online Services (BBOS), a new web-based application that we are targeting to release during Summer 2009.  Use of BBOS beta version is governed by this Agreement. It is also important to understand that BBOS beta version remains under development.  We fully expect that you will uncover issues we never discovered in our testing process.  Additionally, we may periodically need to bring down the BBOS application without prior notice.  <b>Information contained within this BBOS beta version is not real time, production data.  Therefore, you should not rely on the information presented by this beta version when making important credit or business decisions.</b> Moreover, as you simulate submitting data via BBOS beta version, the data will not update Blue Book’s production database.  If you have actual data to report please contact us at 630-668-3500.
