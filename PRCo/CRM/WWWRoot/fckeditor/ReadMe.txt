The fckeditor folder is the older version of CKEditor that can be integrated into CRM.
The original file was downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/fckeditor/
Instructions on how it was integrated into Sage CRM are from https://www.greytrix.com/blogs/sagecrm/2014/08/05/rich-text-editor-on-multiline-text-fields/

There is no physical installation required, just make sure the fckeditor folder exists on the CRM server at D:\Applications\CRM\WWWRoot\fckeditor.
